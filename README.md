# KayLaChess
The KayLaChess Engine is a chess engine written in C++ that will be UCI compatible, with the goal of implementing both the game logic of chess as well as alpha-beta pruning within a NegaMax Framework.

Implementation will be based on the algorithms and ideas found on the [Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Main_Page).

## Implentation
Information on the engine's algorithms will be updated as progress is made, however most of this information can be found by following the above link.

## Performance
Information on the engine's performance will be determined once the AI is implemented.
